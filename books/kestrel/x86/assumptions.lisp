  (and ;; The x86 state is well-formed:
   (x86p x86)

   ;; The model is operating in the application view (ignore paging):
   (equal (app-view x86) t) ;todo: get rid of the (equal ... t) wrapper (may need to improve the rewriter)

   ;; The initial state is error-free:
   (equal (ms x86) nil)
   (equal (fault x86) nil)

   ;; Certain CPU features are enabled (we can extend this list fairly freely as needed):
   ;; Note that we leave the function feature-flag disabled and do not prove a constant opener for it.
   ;; So far, all of these have been needed by actual examples:
   (equal (feature-flag :avx) 1)
   (equal (feature-flag :bmi2) 1)
   (equal (feature-flag :sse) 1)
   (equal (feature-flag :sse2) 1)

   ;; Instead of the assumptions below about the MXCSR, we could just assume
   ;; that it is initially the constant #x1F80.

   ;; Assume denormals are not treated as 0 (this is 0 upon power up or reset
   ;; and is incompatible with IEEE 754)::
   (equal (mxcsrbits->daz (mxcsr x86)) 0)

   ;; Assume exceptions are being masked (these are 1 at power up or reset):
   (equal (mxcsrbits->im (mxcsr x86)) 1)
   (equal (mxcsrbits->dm (mxcsr x86)) 1)
   (equal (mxcsrbits->zm (mxcsr x86)) 1)

   (equal (mxcsrbits->um (mxcsr x86)) 1)
   (equal (mxcsrbits->pm (mxcsr x86)) 1)

   ;; These help with things like SSE/AVX/etc
   (x86isa::cr0bits-p (x86isa::ctri 0 x86)) ; so we can extract the bits
   (equal (x86isa::cr0bits->ts (x86isa::ctri 0 x86)) 0)
   (equal (x86isa::cr0bits->em (x86isa::ctri 0 x86)) 0)

   ;; Assume the rounding mode is round-to-nearest-ties-to-even (the default
