; Comments on the function REWRITE

; The Input
; c term:        the "matrix" term we are to rewrite.
; c alist:       a substitution we are to apply to term before rewriting it.
; h type-alist:  a list of assumptions governing this rewrite
;   obj:         (objective of rewrite) t, nil, or ? - of heuristic use only.
; c geneqv:      a generated equivalence relation to maintain
; c pequiv-info: info on patterned equivalence relations (pequivs) to maintain
;   wrld:        the current world
;   fnstack:     fns and terms currently being expanded - of heuristic use only
; h ancestors:   a list of terms assumed true, modified as we backchain.
; h backchain-limit: of heuristic use only
; h simplify-clause-pot-lst: a pot-lst of polys
; h rcnst:       the rewrite constant arguments
; h ttree:       the evolving ttree describing the rewrites.
;   rdepth:      maximum allowed stack depth - of heuristic use only
;   step-limit:  number of recursive calls permitted for rewrite

; The Output:
; a new step-limit, a term term', and a tag-tree ttree'

; The Specification of Rewrite: The axioms in wrld permit us to infer that the
; Rewrite Assumption implies that term' is equivalent via geneqv+pequiv-info to
; term/alist.  One can write this "wrld |- h -> c."  The args are tagged with h
; and c according to how they are involved in this spec.

; The Rewrite Assumption: the conjunction of (a) the assumptions in type-alist,
; (b) the assumptions in ancestors, (c) the assumption of every "active" poly
; in simplify-clause-pot-lst (where a poly is inactive iff its tag-tree
; contains a 'pt containing some literal number that occurs in the :pt field of
; rcnst), and (d) the 'assumptions in the final tag-tree ttree'.

; Observe that if there are 'assumptions in the incoming ttree they are unioned
; into those made by this rewrite.  Thus, unless you want the assumptions to
; accumulate across many rewrites, you must use the empty initial tag-tree.  It
; would be incorrect to attempt to split on the "new" assumptions in the new
; tag-tree because of the unioning.

; The first value is the rewritten term.  The second is the final
; value of ttree.

; When we rewrite the test of the if we use geneqv iff.  What about
; obj.  Mostly we'll use '?.  But there are a few special cases.
; Suppose you are rewriting (if t1 'nil 't) with the objective t.
; Then you should rewrite t1 with the objective nil.  This actually
; comes up in the handling of (<= x y).  That term opens to (if (< y
; x) 'nil 't).  If we had an obj of t initially, and we don't look
; into the if to see which way the branches go, then we rewrite the (<
; y x) with obj '? and miss an opportunity to use linear arithmetic.

; After Version_3.2.1 we added some more special cases.  Consider the
; following example supplied by Robert Krug.

;    (defstub quux (x) t)
;
;    (defaxiom quux-thm-1

;              (foo-1 (+ x y))))

; Robert pointed out that if instead we switched the order of
; disjuncts in bar-1, the thm fails: (< 4 x) has moved to a test
; position and we had only passed a t or nil :obj down to the true and
; false branches.

;    (defstub foo-2 (x) t)

; Our goal, then, is to recognize the symmetry of OR, AND, and the
