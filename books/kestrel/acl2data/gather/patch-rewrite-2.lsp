; The structure of this function and its immediate,
; rewrite-quoted-constant-with-lemmas, is based on rewrite-with-lemma and
; rewrite-with-lemmas.  Term is a quoted evg, i.e., 'evg, and lemma is an
; enabled :rewrite-quoted-constant rule whose :heuristic-info field contains (n
; . loop-stopper), where n is the form number as per the Essay on Rewriting
; Quoted Constants:

; [1] (IMPLIES hyps (equiv 'lhs-evg 'rhs-evg))
; [2] (IMPLIES hyps (equiv (fn x) x)), where x is a variable.
; [3] (IMPLIES hyps (equiv lhs-term rhs-term))

; In all cases below, we check that equiv is a refinement of geneqv.  Roughly
; speaking, if n is 1 and evg is lhs-evg, we backchain to establish the hyps
; and if successful replace term by 'rhs-evg.  If n is 2 and backchaining
; succeeds and (fn 'evg) returns a non-erroneous result, we replace term with
; the quoted result.  If n is 3, we unify lhs-term with 'evg and if successful
; backchain and rewrite as with an ordinary rewrite rule.

; The four values returned by this function are: a new step-limit, t or nil
; indicating whether lemma was used to rewrite term, the rewritten version of
; term, and the final version of ttree.

; This function is a No-Change Loser modulo rw-cache: only the values of
; 'rw-cache-any-tag and 'rw-cache-nil-tag may differ between the input and
; output ttrees.
