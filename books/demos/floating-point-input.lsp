;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; With the added support for floating point numbers in ACL2, a number i.j is
; interpreted as a double-float (double-precision floating-point number) in raw
; Lisp.  (Technical note: That's because the Common Lisp
; *read-default-float-format* has been set to 'double-float.)

; Logically, ACL2 numbers are all rationals or complex rationals, not floats.
; But it's important to note that in ACL2, raw Lisp evaluation will operate on
; actual double-floats.

; We use the #d prefix (or #D) on a double-float input, F -- that is, we write
; #dF, e.g., #d3.1 -- to indicate the rational value of that double-float,
; which we call a "representable rational" since it is represented by the
; floating-point number indicated by F.  Note that the "d" in "#d" is to
; suggest "double-float" and "decimal", which refers to the notation, not the
; value -- again, the value is the rational number corresponding to the
; double-float following "#d" or "#D".  That double-float has an optional "D"
; or "E" exponent marker (these are equivalent here).  But a "DO" or "E0"
; suffix is required after "#dx" and after "#dx." if x is an integer.

3.1 ; Lisp error -- missing #d prefix

; Floating-point operations in ACL2 operate on representable rationals that are
; considered to be of :df (double-float) type, much as stobj inputs have stobj
; type.  The number returned by any floating-point operation is a representable
; rational that is considered to have :df type, much as stobj-returning
; functions return a value having stobj type.  Below are listed some key
; functions, each with a description that is followed by examples.  Note that
; the result of a :df-returning operation such as to-df is printed using #d
; notation.

; - Dfp is the recognizer for representable rationals.
(dfp 1/4) ; T since 1/4 is representable
(dfp #d0.25) ; T, just as with the preceding, since #d0.25 is read as 1/4
(dfp 1/3) ; NIL since 1/3 is not representable
(dfp 'abc) ; NIL since ABC is not even rational

; - To-df maps a rational number to a close-by representable rational of type
;   :df.  It's implemented in Common Lisp as follows:
;   (to-df x) = (float x 0.0D0).

(to-df 1/4) ; 1/4 is representable; :df returned is #d0.25
(to-df 1/3) ; 1/3 is not representable; we get #d0.3333333333333333

; - From-df maps a :df to its value as a representable rational.
(from-df (to-df #d0.25)) ; 1/4
(from-df (to-df 1/4)) ; 1/4 (same input as the preceding)
(from-df (to-df 1/3)) ; an ugly rational

; Syntax error: the constant 1/4 is not a :df.  However, (from-df 1/4)
; logically equals 1/4, as shown in the thm below.
(from-df 1/4)

(from-df #d0.25) ; same error as preceding, since #d0.25 is read as 1/4

(thm (equal (from-df 1/4) 1/4))

; - To-dfp maps rationals to representable rationals by the composition:
;   (to-dfp x) = (from-df (to-df x)).
(to-dfp 1/4) ; 1/4, since 1/4 is representable
(to-dfp 1/3) ; ugly rational since 1/3 is not representable

; Here are a few more examples.

; First, let's look at a difference in output between calls of to-df and
; to-dfp.  The results are logically equal, but to-df returns a :DF while
; to-dfp returns an ordinary object.  Further comments are below.

; The next form returns a :df, displayed as #d3.1:
(to-df 31/10)

; The next form returns an ugly rational equal to #d3.1:
(to-dfp 31/10)

; We can see the difference in output "types" by looking at the
; signatures of to-df and to-dfp, as follows.  (This also shows the
; guards and output "Type" formulas.)

:args to-df
:args to-dfp

; The phenomenon we see above, of different output for logically equal
; results, is familiar to users using STATE and other stobjs.  Suppose
; we introduce the single-threaded object my-st with one field named
; fld, i.e., (defstobj my-st fld).  Then this is a theorem:

; (thm (equal (and (my-stp my-st) (equal (fld my-st) 'abc))
;             (equal my-st '(abc))))

; [Note: to prove it we need a lemma, and this one suffices:
; (defthm non-nil-true-listp-has-nonzero-len
;   (implies (and (true-listp x) x) (< 0 (len x)))
;   :rule-classes :linear)]

; That is, if my-st is a my-stp and its fld contains ABC then my-st is equal to
; '(ABC).

; But the following sequence of evaluations shows that when we configure the
; live my-st to have fld ABC it prints as <my-st>, not as (ABC), even
; though we (and the theorem prover) know that such a my-st is equal to
; (ABC).

; ACL2 !>(update-fld 'abc my-st)
; <my-st>
; ACL2 !>(and (my-stp my-st) (equal (fld my-st) 'abc))
; T
; ACL2 !>my-st
; <my-st>
; ACL2 !>'(abc)
; (ABC)

; So this live my-st and '(abc) are equal in the session above, but they are
; displayed differently by ACL2 when printed at the top-level.  ACL2 users
; are used to this and now we see this same behavior when using :df objects.
; You'll get used to it.

(assert-event

; Value and value-triple print correctly, by printing a space (by default)
; before the value to indicate that a triple (mv nil _ state) is returned.
; However, value-triple prints the value without using #d notation; think of
; value-triple as returning the logical value without pretending to return a
; double-float (as value does) -- the difference is that (value x) expands to
; (mv nil x state) while (value-triple x) performs a less direct sort of
; evaluation.  Also, note the use of :stobjs-out with value-triple.

; Here are examples using the :df operation, df+.  Note that df+
; and other built in "df" operations are actually macros, which
; convert rational constant inputs to have :df type.  Also note
; that, as shown above for to-df, a result of type :df is

(df+ 1/4 1/3) ; error: 1/3 is non-representable constant arg of df+

; The following two examples illustrate that df+ is actually a macro

; -- just please take away the idea that floating-point numbers are

; as df+, are optimized to do floating-point operations in raw Lisp.

; Our next goal is to assert a failure of associativity discussed
; above, but this time using LET-bindings.  However, first we'll shown
; two ill-formed attempts to do that, as a means to explain why the
; successful example is written the way it is.

; Here is our first attempt to use LET-bindings to show a violation of
; associativity.  It fails because df+ expects its arguments to be of
; type :df -- except that, as illustrated above, numbers are
; converted to type :df by wrapping them in a call of to-df.
; (Also any argument that is a defined constant symbol or a quoted
; rational gets a to-df wrapper.)  No such wrapping occurs for
; variables, however; so in particular, (df+ x y) macroexpands to
; (binary-df+ x y), which is ill-formed because its arguments are
; ordinary objects rather than of :df type.
(let ((x #d.1)
      (y #d.2)
      (z #d.3))
  (not (equal (df+ (df+ x y) z)
              (df+ x (df+ y z)))))

; It doesn't help to declare the let-bound variables to be double-float,
; because #d.1 is really a rational.
(let ((x #d.1)
      (y #d.2)
      (z #d.3))
  (declare (type double-float x y z))
  (not (equal (df+ (df+ x y) z)
              (df+ x (df+ y z)))))

; Here is our second attempt to use LET-bindings to show a violation
; of associativity.  It fixes the problem from the preceding input by
; applying to-df in each binding, so that each bound variable is
; seen to have :df type.  But it still causes an error, because
; equal expects arguments that represent ordinary objects, yet here
; the arguments of equal are of type :df because they are produced
; by df+.
(let ((x (to-df #d.1))
      (y (to-df #d.2))
      (z (to-df #d.3)))
  (not (equal (df+ (df+ x y) z)
              (df+ x (df+ y z))))) ; error

(assert-event
; Here we finally succeed in our assertion of the failure of
; associativity, fixing the problems illustrated by the two preceding
; attempts.  We fix the first of those two attempts by applying to-df
; in the bindings, as explained just above.  We fix the second
; attempt, accommodating the fact that equal accepts only ordinary
; arguments, not dfs, by applying from-df to each argument of equal.
; From-df is logically the identity function, but maps a :df (whose
; value is a representable rational) to an ordinary object (that
; rational).
 (let ((x (to-df #d.1))
       (y (to-df #d.2))
       (z (to-df #d.3)))
   (not (equal (from-df (df+ (df+ x y) z))
               (from-df (df+ x (df+ y z)))))))

(assert-event
 (let ((x (to-df #d.1))
       (y (to-df #d.2))
       (z (to-df #d.3)))
   (not (df= (df+ (df+ x y) z)
             (df+ x (df+ y z))))))

(assert-event

; signature (mv :DF *).  Since f27-bad has no such declaration, in that case it
; is assumed that f27 returns (mv * *), and translation fails since (df0)
; returns a df, which is not compatible with the return type of (mv * *) that
; was deduced when translating the mv-let expression.
