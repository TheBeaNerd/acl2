; Update this file when an ACL2 system change requires recertifying all

; required.

Forcing recertification 4/19/2024 for commit, "Increased ACL2 analogue
of maximum fixnum from 2^29-1 to 2^60-1."  The value of *fixnum-bits*
has changed (and thus so have at least *fixnat-bits*, the-fixnum,
fixnum-bound, and *default-step-limit*), making it potentially unsound
to books certified with an earlier ACL2 version.
