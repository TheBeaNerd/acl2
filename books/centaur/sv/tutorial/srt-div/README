This contains a proof of correctness for a simple 32-bit radix-4 SRT
divider. To run this proof, you need to separately download the
divider implementation.  This can be done by running the following git
command in this directory:

   git clone https://github.com/solswords/SRT-4-DIVISION SRT-4-DIVISION -b v0.0

or equivalently:

  ./getdivider.sh

This will put the RTL for the divider where it is expected by the
proof scripts.  Additionally, you need to then set environment
variable SRTDIV_HAS_IMPLEMENTATION to a nonempty string -- otherwise,
proofs.lisp will certify with nothing in it since the whole proof will
be IFDEF'd out:

  # bash:
  export SRTDIV_HAS_IMPLEMENTATION=1
  
  # csh:
  setenv SRTDIV_HAS_IMPLEMENTATION 1

Attribution: the divider implementation was forked from
https://github.com/wzc810049078/SRT-4-DIVISION, which has an Apache
2.0 open source license.  We modified it to produce the result at a
fixed latency rather than as soon as possible.
