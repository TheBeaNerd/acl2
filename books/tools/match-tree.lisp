;; Notes.  This book defines a B* binder UNLESS-MATCH which uses a function
;; MATCH-TREE to check that a term matches a particular pattern and return an
;; alist of values of particular subterms.

;; It can be used for matching various sorts of cons trees, but is particularly
;; focused on terms and term lists, for purposes of meta-reasoning.

;; A pattern P matches a tree X and produces bindings as follows:

;; Match conditions                                 Bindings produced
;; P is an atom and P = X
;; P is (:? <symb>)                                 (<symb> . X)
;; P is (:! <symb>)                                 (<symb> . X)
;; P is (:?S <symb>) and X is a symbol              (<symb> . X)
;; P is (:?V <symb>) and X is a nonnil symbol       (<symb> . X)
;; P is (:?F <symb>) and X is a non-quote symbol    (<symb> . X)
;; P is (:?L <symb>) and X is not quote             (<symb> . X)
;; P is none of the above,
;;      (car P) matches (car X),
;;      (cdr P) matches (cdr X),                    car bindings
;;      and the car and cdrs' bindings                UNION
;;      agree on all symbols bound in both.         cdr bindings.

;; MATCH-TREE takes three arguments, P (pattern), X (target), and A
;; (alist/accumulator).  The above rules pertain to when A is empty.  If A is
;; not empty, then the match is OK iff the bindings to be produced agree with
;; the bindings in A on any symbols bound in both.

;; The various :?x pattern types are intended to support various parts of ACL2
;; terms:
;;    :?S matches any symbol
;;    :?V matches a variable symbol, by which we mean any other than NIL, which
;;        is treated differently from other symbols by evaluators
;;    :?F matches a function symbol, by which we mean any symbol other than
;;        QUOTE, which is not a function according to evalautors
;;    :?L matches anything but the symbol QUOTE, making it appropriate for
;;        cases where we might not care whether the result is a function or
;;        a lambda.


;; UNLESS-MATCH is a B* binder that applies match-tree to a certain value
;; and (explicit, not evaluated) pattern.  If it matches, the remainder of the
;; B* form is run with any symbols inside :? binders bound as variables; if it
;; doesn't match, an early-exit is taken.  For example:

;; (b* (((unless-match x (if (:? a) (:? a) ((:?f g) (:?v q))))
;;       (er hard? 'my-match-fn "X didn't match the IF term"))
;;      (g-call (list g q)))
;;   (cw "x matched: ~x0~%" `(or ,a ,g-call)))

;; expands to, more or less,

;; (mv-let (ok alist)
;;   (match-tree x '(if (:? a) (:? a) ((:?f g) (:?v q))) nil)
;;   (if ok
;;       ;; bind the variables of the pattern
;;       (let* ((a (cdr (assoc 'a alist)))
;;              (g (cdr (assoc 'g alist)))
;;              (q (cdr (assoc 'q alist))))
;;         ;; rest of the B* form:
;;         (b* ((g-call (list g q)))
;;           (cw "x matched: ~x0~%" `(or ,a ,g-call))))
;;     (er hard? 'my-match-fn "X didn't match the IF term")))

;; The difference between the :? and :! binders is in how UNLESS-MATCH treats
;; them -- MATCH-TREE treats them both the same.  The symbol inside a :! binder
;; should be already bound, and UNLESS-MATCH will put its binding in the
;; initial alist so that the corresponding subtree of the target must be equal
;; to that value.  For example,

;; (b* (((unless-match x (f (:? var1) (:! var2)))
;;       (er hard? 'sfdf "X didn't match")))
;;   var1)

;; expands to, approximately:
;; (mv-let (ok alist)
;;   (match-free x '(f (:? var1) (:! var2))
;;               ;; initial alist:
;;               (list (cons 'var2 var2)))
;;   (if ok
;;       (let* ((var1 (cdr (assoc 'var1 alist)))
;;              (var2 (cdr (assoc 'var2 alist))))
;;         var1)
;;     (er hard? 'sfdf "X didn't match")))


;; Using match-tree in meta-reasoning.

;; The crucial theorem here is MATCH-TREE-IS-SUBST-TREE:

;; (defthmd match-tree-is-subst-tree
;;   (b* (((mv ok alist) (match-tree pat x alist)))
;;     (implies ok
;;              (equal (subst-tree pat alist) x)))
;;   :hints (("goal" :induct (match-tree pat x alist))))

;;  However, generally, you won't see a term of the form on the LHS of this
;;  theorem, so it won't be used much.  Instead, use this to prove a similar
;;  theorem that rewrites X to the SUBST-TREE term, but in certain desirable
;;  contexts.  E.g., if you have an evaluator, MY-EV, you may want to prove:

;; (defthm match-tree-is-subst-tree-for-my-ev
;;   (b* (((mv ok alist) (match-tree pat x alist)))
;;     (implies ok
;;              (equal (my-ev x a)
;;                     (my-ev (subst-tree pat alist) a))))
;;   :hints (("goal" :induct (match-tree pat x alist))))

;; This could be expensive, since ACL2 will try to apply this rule for every
;; MY-EV term it encounters.  However, generally these applications will be
;; pretty cheap, because the first thing ACL2 will do is look in the type-alist
;; for a known-true term (mv-nth 0 (match-tree pat x alist)); if it doesn't
;; find one, then it'll give up.  For the case where it does find one, we
;; generally leave subst-tree enabled so that the subst-tree term will be
;; rewritten into a semi-explicit term, which is often what you want.

;; The following theorems are also important:
;;   - match-tree-binders-bound: the bound variables of pattern are bound in
;;     the alist
;;   - symbolp-by-match-tree-restrictions: elements bound by :?s, :?v, :?f are
;;     symbols
;;   - not-quote-by-match-tree-restrictions: elements bound by :?f, :?l are not
;;     quote
;;   - not-nil-by-match-tree-restrictions: elements bound by :?v are not nil

;; Finally, you may notice that your theorems get huge and difficult to read if
;; you make extensive use of unless-match.  To solve this problem, we offer a
;; utility DEF-MATCH-TREE-REWRITES.  This is an event-creating macro that makes
;; several functions named after the :?-bound symbols in a match-tree
;; pattern.  Each function's value is the binding of that symbol in the result,
;; and we introduce a rewrite rule to rewrite that lookup into the
;; function. So:

;; (def-match-tree-rewrites (fa (fip (:? my-fa-fip-arg))))
;; produces:
;; (defund my-fa-fip-arg (x)
;;   (declare (xargs :guard t))
;;   (mv-let (ok alist)
;;     (match-tree '(fa (fip (:? my-fa-fip-arg))) x nil)
;;     (and ok (cdr (assoc 'my-fa-fip-arg alist)))))
;; (defthm my-fa-fip-arg-rw
;;   (mv-let (ok alist)
;;     (match-tree '(fa (fip (:? my-fa-fip-arg))) x nil)
;;     (implies ok
;;              (equal (cdr (assoc 'my-fa-fip-arg alist))
;;                     (my-fa-fip-arg x))))).
;; Additional theorems about the types of these functions are produced when :?x
;; forms are used.  The functions take additional arguments when :! forms are
;; used.


;; Rager notes in May 2013 that it can be helpful to use variable names that
;; are the same.  For example, when submitting the following two forms, the use
;; of "id" in the first but "id-name" in the second is enough to keep the
;; prover from verifying the guards for the second define (Rager did not try
;; any hints).  This example had two accompanying uses of
;; def-match-tree-rewrites (not shown here).

  :long
  " 
<p>Match-tree is a function that takes a pattern, object, and alist, and
returns two values: matchedp, which is true only if the pattern matched the
object under the bindings already present in alist, and result-alist, an
extension of the input alist containing the unifying substitution.</p>

<p>Invocation:</p>
@({
  (match-tree pattern obj alist)
 -->
  (mv matchedp new-alist)
 )}     

<p>Pseudo-formally, if the input alist is empty, a pattern P matches an object
X and produces bindings as follows:</p>

@({
  Match conditions                                 Bindings produced
  P is an atom and P = X
  P is (:? <symb>)                                 (<symb> . X)
  P is (:! <symb>)                                 (<symb> . X)
  P is (:?S <symb>) and X is a symbol              (<symb> . X)
  P is (:?V <symb>) and X is a nonnil symbol       (<symb> . X)
  P is (:?F <symb>) and X is a non-quote symbol    (<symb> . X)
  P is (:?L <symb>) and X is not quote             (<symb> . X)
  P is none of the above,
       (car P) matches (car X),
       (cdr P) matches (cdr X),                    car bindings
       and the car and cdrs' bindings                UNION
       agree on all symbols bound in both.         cdr bindings.
 })

<p>If the input alist is not empty, then the bindings produced must also agree
with any bindings of the same symbols that are present in the input alist, and
the result alist is the bindings unioned with the input alist.</p>

<p>The @('(:! x)') binding pattern is the same as @('(:? x)') in match-tree
itself, but is treated differently by macros @(see treematch), @(see
when-match), and @(see unless-match); see below.</p>

<h2>Macro support</h2>

<p>Match-tree supports the utility @(see treematch), which is similar in spirit to @(see case-match); e.g., </p>

@({
 (treematch x
   ((cons (:? a) (:? b))    (list a b))
   ((foo (:v q))            (list q))
   (&                       (list x)))
 })
<p>expands to approximately:</p>
@({
 (b* (
      ;; (cons (:? a) (:? b)) case:
      ((mv matchedp alist) (match-tree '(cons (:? a) (:? b)) x nil))
      ((when matchedp)
       (let* ((a (cdr (assoc 'a alist)))
              (b (cdr (assoc 'b alist))))
          (list a b)))

      ;; (foo (:v q)) case:
      ((mv matchedp alist) (match-tree '(foo (:v q) (:? y)) x nil))
      ((when matchedp)
       (let* ((q (cdr (assoc 'q alist))))
          (list q))))

   ;; default case:
   (list x))
 })

<p>When a pattern contains @('(:! x)') binders, @('treematch') invokes
match-tree with an alist consisting of the previous bindings of those
variables; then, the pattern will only match if the corresponding location in
the object is equal to the existing binding of the variable, like in @(see
case-match) when a symbol is prefixed with @('!').  For example, in the
following form:</p>

@({
 (let ((y 'bar))
   (treematch x
      ((foo (:! y))  ...)
      ...))
 })
<p>the match-tree call generated is:</p>
@({
 (match-tree '(foo (:! y)) x (list (cons 'y y)))
 })
<p>which means that this match will only succeed if x equals @('(foo bar)').</p>

<p>Two @(see B*) binders @('unless-match') and @('when-match') also use match-tree.  One can think of them as expending to a call of @('treematch') with one pattern and a default:</p>

@({
 (b* (((when-match obj pattern)
       match-form))
    default-form)
 })
<p>and</p>
@({
 (b* (((unless-match obj pattern)
       default-form))
    match-form)
 })
<p>are both basically equivalent to</p>
@({
 (treematch obj
   (pattern match-form)
   (& default-form))
 })
    
<h2>Reasoning</h2>

<p>The main advantage of match-tree over case-match is reasoning
efficiency. When using case-match, each pattern-matching form macroexpands to a
conjunction of conditions followed by a series of bindings.  These are
relatively automatic to reason about, but they make it difficult to debug
problems in proofs (because it takes a lot of reading and decoding car/cdr
nests to figure out which patterns did and did not match), and they are
expensive to reason about because when a pattern does NOT match, ACL2 typically
splits into cases for the disjunction of the matching conditions.</p>

<p>Since match-tree is a function, the user can control how or whether to open
it.  We offer a couple of levels of reasoning about it, bundled in theories.</p>

<p>We generally rewrite the second (new-alist) return value of @('match-tree')
to @('match-tree-alist').  This is a simpler function with fewer conditionals
that equals that value whenever the pattern matches; presumably the alist isn't
relevant otherwise. The theory @('match-tree-alist-opener-theory') opens calls
of @('match-tree-alist').  You may additionally want a rule such as
@('assoc-equal-of-cons') to simplify lookups in the alist.</p>

<p>We generally rewrite the first return value (matchedp) to
@('match-tree-matchedp') (which is equivalent) when the match was successful.
However, we can use different rules to do this and these rules have different
side effects to help with reasoning:</p>

<ul>
<li>@('match-tree-equals-match-tree-matchedp-when-successful') simply
rewrites the @('matchedp') return value to @('match-tree-matchedp'), without side
effects.</li>

<li>@('match-tree-obj-equals-subst-when-successful') rewrites the @('matchedp')
value to the conjunction of @('match-tree-matchedp') and a term equating the
object with the substitution of the result alist into the pattern.  Rules that
expand the substitution are enabled by default, so this quickly produces a
hypothesis that gives the shape of the object defined by the pattern.</li>

<li>@('match-tree-open-when-successful') rewrites the @('matchedp') value to
the conjunction of @('match-tree-matchedp') and @('match-tree-matchedp-open'),
and equivalent function that has rules to open calls on known patterns enabled
by default (collected in the theory @('match-tree-opener-theory').</li>

<li>@('match-tree-obj-equals-subst-and-open-when-successful') rewrites the
@('matchedp') value to the conjunction of all three: @('match-tree-matchedp'),
@('match-tree-matchedp-open'), and the equivalence of the object with the
substitution.</li>

</ul>

<p>These rules only take effect when we see the @('matchedp') return value as a
negative literal (hypothesis/negated conclusion) of a clause, not when
backchaining or a positive literal (negated hypothesis/conclusion).  To prove
that a pattern does in fact match, or a consequence when it doesn't match, the
rule @('match-tree-open') unconditionally rewrites the matchedp value to
@('match-tree-matchedp-open'), which by default opens into a conjunction of
conditions.</p>

  ;; Notes.  This book defines a B* binder UNLESS-MATCH which uses a function
;; MATCH-TREE to check that a term matches a particular pattern and return an
;; alist of values of particular subterms.

;; It can be used for matching various sorts of cons trees, but is particularly
;; focused on terms and term lists, for purposes of meta-reasoning.

;; A pattern P matches a tree X and produces bindings as follows:

;; Match conditions                                 Bindings produced
;; P is an atom and P = X
;; P is (:? <symb>)                                 (<symb> . X)
;; P is (:! <symb>)                                 (<symb> . X)
;; P is (:?S <symb>) and X is a symbol              (<symb> . X)
;; P is (:?V <symb>) and X is a nonnil symbol       (<symb> . X)
;; P is (:?F <symb>) and X is a non-quote symbol    (<symb> . X)
;; P is (:?L <symb>) and X is not quote             (<symb> . X)
;; P is none of the above,
;;      (car P) matches (car X),
;;      (cdr P) matches (cdr X),                    car bindings
;;      and the car and cdrs' bindings                UNION
;;      agree on all symbols bound in both.         cdr bindings.

;; MATCH-TREE takes three arguments, P (pattern), X (target), and A
;; (alist/accumulator).  The above rules pertain to when A is empty.  If A is
;; not empty, then the match is OK iff the bindings to be produced agree with
;; the bindings in A on any symbols bound in both.

;; The various :?x pattern types are intended to support various parts of ACL2
;; terms:
;;    :?S matches any symbol
;;    :?V matches a variable symbol, by which we mean any other than NIL, which
;;        is treated differently from other symbols by evaluators
;;    :?F matches a function symbol, by which we mean any symbol other than
;;        QUOTE, which is not a function according to evalautors
;;    :?L matches anything but the symbol QUOTE, making it appropriate for
;;        cases where we might not care whether the result is a function or
;;        a lambda.


;; UNLESS-MATCH is a B* binder that applies match-tree to a certain value
;; and (explicit, not evaluated) pattern.  If it matches, the remainder of the
;; B* form is run with any symbols inside :? binders bound as variables; if it
;; doesn't match, an early-exit is taken.  For example:

;; (b* (((unless-match x (if (:? a) (:? a) ((:?f g) (:?v q))))
;;       (er hard? 'my-match-fn "X didn't match the IF term"))
;;      (g-call (list g q)))
;;   (cw "x matched: ~x0~%" `(or ,a ,g-call)))

;; expands to, more or less,

;; (mv-let (ok alist)
;;   (match-tree x '(if (:? a) (:? a) ((:?f g) (:?v q))) nil)
;;   (if ok
;;       ;; bind the variables of the pattern
;;       (let* ((a (cdr (assoc 'a alist)))
;;              (g (cdr (assoc 'g alist)))
;;              (q (cdr (assoc 'q alist))))
;;         ;; rest of the B* form:
;;         (b* ((g-call (list g q)))
;;           (cw "x matched: ~x0~%" `(or ,a ,g-call))))
;;     (er hard? 'my-match-fn "X didn't match the IF term")))

;; The difference between the :? and :! binders is in how UNLESS-MATCH treats
;; them -- MATCH-TREE treats them both the same.  The symbol inside a :! binder
;; should be already bound, and UNLESS-MATCH will put its binding in the
;; initial alist so that the corresponding subtree of the target must be equal
;; to that value.  For example,

;; (b* (((unless-match x (f (:? var1) (:! var2)))
;;       (er hard? 'sfdf "X didn't match")))
;;   var1)

;; expands to, approximately:
;; (mv-let (ok alist)
;;   (match-free x '(f (:? var1) (:! var2))
;;               ;; initial alist:
;;               (list (cons 'var2 var2)))
;;   (if ok
;;       (let* ((var1 (cdr (assoc 'var1 alist)))
;;              (var2 (cdr (assoc 'var2 alist))))
;;         var1)
;;     (er hard? 'sfdf "X didn't match")))


;; Using match-tree in meta-reasoning.

;; The crucial theorem here is MATCH-TREE-IS-SUBST-TREE:

;; (defthmd match-tree-is-subst-tree
;;   (b* (((mv ok alist) (match-tree pat x alist)))
;;     (implies ok
;;              (equal (subst-tree pat alist) x)))
;;   :hints (("goal" :induct (match-tree pat x alist))))

;;  However, generally, you won't see a term of the form on the LHS of this
;;  theorem, so it won't be used much.  Instead, use this to prove a similar
;;  theorem that rewrites X to the SUBST-TREE term, but in certain desirable
;;  contexts.  E.g., if you have an evaluator, MY-EV, you may want to prove:

;; (defthm match-tree-is-subst-tree-for-my-ev
;;   (b* (((mv ok alist) (match-tree pat x alist)))
;;     (implies ok
;;              (equal (my-ev x a)
;;                     (my-ev (subst-tree pat alist) a))))
;;   :hints (("goal" :induct (match-tree pat x alist))))

;; This could be expensive, since ACL2 will try to apply this rule for every
;; MY-EV term it encounters.  However, generally these applications will be
;; pretty cheap, because the first thing ACL2 will do is look in the type-alist
;; for a known-true term (mv-nth 0 (match-tree pat x alist)); if it doesn't
;; find one, then it'll give up.  For the case where it does find one, we
;; generally leave subst-tree enabled so that the subst-tree term will be
;; rewritten into a semi-explicit term, which is often what you want.

;; The following theorems are also important:
;;   - match-tree-binders-bound: the bound variables of pattern are bound in
;;     the alist
;;   - symbolp-by-match-tree-restrictions: elements bound by :?s, :?v, :?f are
;;     symbols
;;   - not-quote-by-match-tree-restrictions: elements bound by :?f, :?l are not
;;     quote
;;   - not-nil-by-match-tree-restrictions: elements bound by :?v are not nil

;; Finally, you may notice that your theorems get huge and difficult to read if
;; you make extensive use of unless-match.  To solve this problem, we offer a
;; utility DEF-MATCH-TREE-REWRITES.  This is an event-creating macro that makes
;; several functions named after the :?-bound symbols in a match-tree
;; pattern.  Each function's value is the binding of that symbol in the result,
;; and we introduce a rewrite rule to rewrite that lookup into the
;; function. So:

;; (def-match-tree-rewrites (fa (fip (:? my-fa-fip-arg))))
;; produces:
;; (defund my-fa-fip-arg (x)
;;   (declare (xargs :guard t))
;;   (mv-let (ok alist)
;;     (match-tree '(fa (fip (:? my-fa-fip-arg))) x nil)
;;     (and ok (cdr (assoc 'my-fa-fip-arg alist)))))
;; (defthm my-fa-fip-arg-rw
;;   (mv-let (ok alist)
;;     (match-tree '(fa (fip (:? my-fa-fip-arg))) x nil)
;;     (implies ok
;;              (equal (cdr (assoc 'my-fa-fip-arg alist))
;;                     (my-fa-fip-arg x))))).
;; Additional theorems about the types of these functions are produced when :?x
;; forms are used.  The functions take additional arguments when :! forms are
;; used.
