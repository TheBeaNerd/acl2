This README file explains how to read the examples in brr-input.lsp,
which support the paper "Advances in ACL2 Proof Debugging Tools" by
Matt Kaufmann and J Strother Moore.

File brr-input.lsp has input forms that are processed when certifying
the book, brr-book.lisp, which generates an output file identical to
file brr-log.txt.  So you may want to look at brr-log.txt to see what
is generated by brr-input.lsp.
