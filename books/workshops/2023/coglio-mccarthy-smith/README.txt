Most of the supporting materials for the ACL2-2023 Workshop paper "Formal
Verification of Zero-Knowledge Circuits" by A. Coglio, E. McCarthy, and E. Smith
are in the community books, in the places indicated in the paper itself, as well
as in the ../README file.

This directory contains the rest of the supporting materials, which consists of
two files. These two files are specific to the paper. These two files may be
moved elsewhere in the community books (e.g. in the R1CS and PFCS libraries) at
some point.
